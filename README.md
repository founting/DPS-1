# DPS-1
This is the first assignment of DPS from group 12.

To better understand the usage and performance of Hadoop and Spark, we deploy the two frameworks on [DAS-5 cluster](https://www.cs.vu.nl/das5/) and try to reproduce the experiments on K-Means and PageRank applications conducted in [this paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi12/nsdi12-final138.pdf) to compare their performance in terms of speed and throughput. We finish this assignment with the help of [HiBench](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HiBench), which is a big data benchmark suite for performance evaluation.
